# FoodPlan

I like cooking and I like planning. But sometimes trying to remember to create a shopping list whilst you have uni coursework can sometimes be a bit irritating.

To solve this, this project allows me to add my meals to MongoDB, then I can generate my weekly shopping list with a few clicks!

I made it just to save me some time here and there.
